# Survey Question Screens - Front End Developer Task

This repository contains my solution to the Front End Developer task for SHAPE Global. The task was to design a simple survey with multiple questions using React, and handle data fetching and saving via a JSON file.

## Project Overview
The objective of this project is to build a user-friendly interface for a survey with five different types of questions. The responses collected from the user are stored in a JSON file after completing the survey. The task includes the following:
Title Selection: Dropdown for selecting the user's title.
Date of Birth: Input fields to select the user's day, month, and year of birth with validation.
Performance Rating: A rating scale from 1 to 10 to assess other workers' performance.
Sources of Stress: A free-text input field to enter any additional sources of stress.
Work-Life Balance: A multiple-choice question regarding the balance between work and non-work activities.
The user responses are saved in a JSON file after submitting the survey.

## Features
React-based UI: The project is built using React for creating an interactive user interface.
Responsive Design: The survey screens are designed to work seamlessly across different devices.
JSON Storage: Data is fetched from and saved to a JSON file at the end of the survey.
Form Validation: Validations are applied to ensure the accuracy of inputs, particularly for the date of birth.
